is designed for use with IntelliJ and Java, for parts that are purely Java; projects that use Android will require Android Studio. 


Our very own Mike Walker has created videos on [installing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs251-003/lecture/ZFnCv/git-installation-tutorial) and [using](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs251-003/lecture/mgcbj/git-usage-tutorial) Git. another video explaining how to use Git in the context of Android is available [here](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/276/bfraser/videolist.html "Link: http://www.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/276/bfraser/videolist.html"). A "cheat sheet" for using Git is available [here](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) and step-by-step instructions for using GitHub are available [here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git "Link: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git"). Finally, a video explaining the basics of Git and GitHub is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8GBXvdmHT4 "Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8GBXvdmHT4").

IntelliJ may be downloaded from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/#chooseYourEdition).  You may select either version; this class will use only features found in the community edition.  Your status as a Vanderbilt student also entitles you to an Ultimate license as long as you are a student.  

You will be required to make a Gitlab account.  You may do so [here](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in)(See 'New User' if you do not have an account).  Once you have created your account, ensure that you are logged in, andyou will find a screen that looks like this:

Here, you will need to give the TAs access to your repository.  Do that by adding the 'cs-251-spring-2016' group with 'Master' permissions:
