<LI> <B> What are the course objectives?</b>

      <P>Upon completing this course, students should be able to:
        <ul>
          <li><p>Recognize the inherent and accidental
            complexities involved with developing object-oriented and generic software .</p></li>
          <li><p>Understand how pattern-oriented software
            architecture and framework techniques can and cannot help to
            alleviate these complexities.</p></li>
          <li><p>Apply patterns and
            frameworks to develop reusable and resilient 
            applications and services using the Java object-oriented
            programming language and Android middleware.</p></li>
          <li><p>Know
            where to find additional sources of information on how to
            program applications and services on Android handheld
            systems.</p></li>
        </ul></P>

    <li><b>How does this course compare/contrast with the Coursera MOOC Specialization on <A HREF="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/mobilecloudcomputing/2">Mobile Cloud Computing with Android</a>?</b>

         <p>The material in both courses focuses on teaching mobile software
        development at both a conceptual level (e.g., an understanding
        of software patterns, object-oriented design, and frameworks)
        and a practical level (e.g., gain experience programming Android
        applications using Java and Eclipse). Students in
        both courses are also expected to be (1) familiar with Java 
        and (2) capable of learning new material (such as Eclipse and the Git source code control tools) without significant hand-holding by the teachers and course staff. Some lecture
        material in CS 251 is based on the material in the Coursera MOOC (see <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK">YouTube
        channel</a>). The quizzes, programming assignments, and degree
        of feedback for this course are different, however,
        since we only have several dozen students (instead of ~80,000 students), so
        the assignments are much more challenging and there's significantly more personalized guidance and in-depth assessments from the
        teachers and course staff that can't be replicated in a MOOC (yet).</p>

    <li><b>What are your assumptions about--and expectations
        for--students taking CS 251?</b>

      <p>As mentioned in FAQ item #2 above, this course is based on material we've crafted for the Coursera MOOC Specialization on Mobile Cloud Computing with Android. This
        material is intended for self-motivated students who
        <ul>
        <li> Know Java, Eclipse, and Git (or can learn them quickly on
        their own) 
        <li> Want to understand both the concepts and
        practice of developing object-oriented and generic software applications and services
        <li> Are curious about how the Android software stack itself is designed and implemented
        <li> Are willing/able to carefully read/follow the instructions in the course assignments and 
        announcements. 
        </ul><p>
           </li>

  <li> <b>Can students take this course if they have little/no prior
      experience programming Java in Eclipse?</b>

      <p>Our course assumes that students are comfortable programming
        in Java. If you don't have any Java programming background you
        might consider taking the course <a
        href="https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/">Java for Complete
        Beginners</a>. 
      </p>
    </li>

<li> <b>What happens if we don't submit our code for peer evaluation by the deadline?</b>

      <p>Not having your code available for peer evaluation adds extra work for the course staff. Therefore, if you don't submit your code for peer evaluation by the deadline you will receive a 20% deduction on your final score for the assignment.
      </p>
    </li>

<li> <b>How does the graduate material differ from the undergraduate material?</b>

      <p>Students taking this course for graduate credit have additional work on each assignment, quiz, and final exam.
      </p>
    </li>

<li> <b>Where is the C++ version of this course?</b>

      <p>The lectures and assignments from the most recent C++ version of this course is available <A HREF="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/cs251/C++/">here</a>.
      </p>
    </li>

<li> <b>Who is eligible to enroll in this class and access the material?</b>

      <p>Anyone is welcome to watch the videos on my YouTube <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp7lylj-XC8h1kjatOjbh9ne">CS 251 playlist</a> and do the <A HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS251/tree/master/assignments">programming assignments</a>.  However, only Vanderbilt students can enroll in this class and access the other material at the course website.  At some point, this material may be included in a MOOC, but that hasn't been finalized yet.
      </p>
    </li>

<li> <b>When will the screencasts of the class lectures be available?</b>

      <p>The screencasts will typically be posted soon after each class lecture is given, starting on Monday January 5th 2015 and continuing until the end of April 2015.  There are typically two lectures a week (Monday and Wednesday), but the lectures aren't always published as screencasts, depending on what is covered that day.  In particular, the answers to quizzes and programming assignments aren't posted as screencasts.
      </p>
    </li>

<li> <b>What information (if any) is needed at the top of the programming assignment submissions?</b>

      <p> It is not necessary to include comments at the top of your source code files with your name, email, honor code statement, assignment name, date, etc. since
<ul>
<li>We're using GitLal, so the course staff know whose code we're reviewing
<li>We want to enable "anonymous" peer reviewing, so don't put information indicating authorship in your programs
<LI>The Honor Code applies to everything we do in CS 251, as per discussions in the first class.
</ul>  </p>
